<p style="font-size:24px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 50px;color: #9F2B68 ;background-color: black;"><b>For the first time in my life, I don’t have words to describe how I am feeling. Now I know what it means to have a girl who is really dazzling. I love you.
A day that is devoid of your voice is an incomplete one. For with your voice comes heart-melting laughter, which is all I need to have a great and happy day. I hope mine makes you feel the same way. Good morning my Cherie.
You are my strength. You are not only the sails that steer my ship, but you are also the waves below that carry me. Without you, I would cease to have a backbone, as you are the entire foundation holding me up. I could never think of a day when you are not with me. I imagine if that day came, I would become weak. I would crumble into a coward. But together we are strong. We are unstoppable. That is why I love you.
They say pictures are worth a thousand words but when I look at your picture I can only say three words: I love you.
I want to love you with all that is in me until the end of my days.
I find my purpose in your sight and I exist for your love forever.
I find myself back in love with you every moment. Your love has gradually become a strong reason to live another day on earth. I love you.
I can’t help but love you forever.
If I discovered that anything I said made you smile, I would keep talking forever in the hopes of bringing another grin to your face.
Love isn’t just about beauty, but it’s an added advantage to have a girl as beautiful as you being my girlfriend. You are my heartbeat.
You make me feel safe and secure in your arms. It’s always a comfort to know I can rely on you no matter what happens!
I want to spend the rest of my life loving you, fighting with you, annoying you. All I want in return is for you to hold my hand forever. You are mine and I am yours.<br>
<br>
<br>
I want to thank you for giving me a piece of your heart. You are amazing in every possible way.
You are the twinkle in my eyes and I am so glad and lucky to have you in my life right now!
My words cannot measure the love I have for you. So I try to express my feelings for you through actions. You are my everything!
You are the most beautiful person I have ever seen! It makes me feel that I am the luckiest person in the whole world.
I have found my soulmate in you, and now I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with you.
With you, I can be who I am! You make me feel comfortable and I don’t have to pretend to be someone I am not.
The moment you wrap me around your tight arms, my heart feels safe. Just never let me go!
I keep looking at our photos every few hours. It gives me immense happiness and makes me crave your presence. I miss your laughter. I remember the moments we spent together. The memories that we have made together are never going to fade. They will remain fresh in my mind and I will keep going back to them.
Do you know how bewitching you are? I can’t stop staring at you whenever I see you in a black dress. You set the temperature soaring high! You look every bit ravishing in that dress. And I would love to see you more often in it.
I want to thank you for all the efforts you have put in to make our relationship work. No matter how big the fight was, you always made an effort to talk to me and resolve it peacefully. You always forgive me and find a way to make things work. A big thank you for doing that.
Every time you are around me, it makes my heart flutter. You are the most beautiful person in the whole world. Your beauty is enchanting. It radiates from within. It’s not just about the face, but it comes from your heart, and pure soul, and is reflected in your eyes too.</p>

You are my inspiration and the reason why I smile; my joy and everything. My heart chose to live with you for the rest of my life. I love you from the nooks to the crannies of my heart. Do have a fulfilled day ahead!
The doctor took an X-ray of my heart and almost fainted. He asked me what happened with a scared look on his face. I told him don’t worry, I gave my heart to you. That’s why it is missing.
I am seriously crushing on you and I need you to know this. I am ready to let you know that I am crazy about you, and whatever you say does not matter right now. All that is important is that I like you and I want you to know that.
With you, I discovered true love. I now enjoy the goodness of life that I never knew. The beauty of your love has impacted my life like the sea washes the shores.
I will live the rest of my life thanking God for these attributes he has blessed you with.
If only you would love me today, I’m sure it will last forever. We will have a future as bright as the sun and as tender as a flower. I love you, my sweetheart.<br>
<br>
<br>
I always picture what it would feel like to spend each and every day of the rest of my life with the most beautiful and amazing person in the universe – you. The ecstasy of falling in love with you is unexplainable just as much as my life without you is unimaginable. I love you!
Can I be honest with you? In so many ways, I can attest to how you have changed my life. I am so proud of myself and your utmost patience with me. You have not only supported me during hard situations but also picked me from my lowest points. I could say for a fact that we exist because of what we have.
I must be the luckiest man in the world to have such a special person for their love. When I am next to you, I am always pinching myself to confirm that what I am seeing is real. You are everything that I ever needed in this life and I cannot imagine life without you. I love you, darling.
There were days when you carried me through the rough patches with your calm strength and never-say-die attitude. I am so lucky to have someone like you in my life through thick and thin. Thank you for being you.<br>
<br>

Your beauty and your grace pull me to you, but it is that resilience in your soul that bewitches me. I have never seen a woman who has faced the storms in her life with such tenacity and always has a kind smile for everyone. I love you more every day.
My love for you is unconditional. I will give my all to you, and I expect nothing from you in return. Take it all because you deserve my love, heart, and care. I love you so much, and that’s the only thing I can do well. Kisses.
You have a gift, a gift for a language that nobody but you understands. It’s as if you’re a translator, someone who knows the silent language of my heart’s longing. You know and understand what I need in a way nobody else can.
I can create another odyssey describing my love for you. You have such a profound influence on my life that I cannot erase the memories of you even if I live for a million years. I am lucky to be part of your life. I will love you till my last breath!
Watching you walk across a room is the greatest gift. The way you move is so graceful and easy. The way you smile makes me feel at peace. Knowing you’re walking towards me is a feeling so hard to describe.
The moment I saw you I felt an instant connection, I knew you were the one for me. It was as if we shared an unspoken bond that brought us together.
I love you more than anything in this world. You are my greatest gift and I want to keep you forever. Your presence is truly a treasure, and the absence is the void that cannot be ever filled.
In my eyes, you are the ideal woman, but also indescribable because words seem to limit your awesomeness. You, my dear, have surpassed all my expectations, fantasies, and dreams combined.
Your voice is my favorite melody that I want to keep listening to all my life. It is funny how I thought that I needed no one in my life before you waltzed into it, making me fall irrevocably in love with your nuances and quirks. I love you, my other half.
I promise to help you whenever you need me, support you when you stumble, and lift you when going through troubled waters. My devotion to you is unwavering and I will stand by you no matter what!
You are a precious gem to me! You lighten up my day. You bring light even to the darkest corners of my heart. Such a powerful effect you have on me! I want more of you in my life. I want it all with you, without you, nothing holds any value.
I love the way you always prioritize me and our relationship. Thank you for loving me the way you do! Let’s continue to nurture our bond and grow steadfast in love.<br>
<br>
<br>
You have no clue how fast my heart starts beating when you are around me! Your presence affects me, and it matters to me. When you are not around me, I miss you to the point I can’t wait to be with you because you are all I need, you are my existence.
You are my lifeline! You make my life happier. I need you and cannot stay apart from you even for a day. And when I say that it’s really hard, I mean it. You have no idea how tough it gets to go without seeing you. I miss you to that level when you are not around me.
You are the sole reason that I believe in magic! You have transformed my life through the power of your love. And I have found my true home in you. Your soul is what lights up my world and our love binds us together. That too for eternity!
In your eyes I find solace. You are my safe haven, and you are my shelter amid the storms of life. I find it so comforting that I have you with me in times of distress. The very thought of you helps to ease my anxiety and reduce my pain.
Every day I think that I couldn’t love you more than I already do and yet, I am proven wrong. My love for you continues to grow as the days go by. It keeps growing deeper, higher, and stronger. So, does the fear of losing you. Truly, I am incomplete without you!
If you were a song, I would listen to it over and over again. It would definitely have been my favorite. Yes, one with a soul-stirring effect. It makes me both happy and sad. It’s the only thing I want to start my mornings with and end my nights with.
